# Random-Effects-and-Hierarchical-Linear-Models

In this exercise, we will use hierarchical linear models and regressions with random effects for an analytics problem from a credit card company. The credit card company would like to figure out whether offering more promotions to their existing customers can increase the share-of-wallet of the credit card (that is, the share of a consumer's monthly spending using the credit card in her total spending). The company would also like to figure out what customer characteristics make them more responsive to promotions. 

The company conducted a field experiment by randomly selecting 300 customers and offering them different monthly promotions for 12 months. The share-of-wallet data were recorded in each month for every customer. The data set also included some consumer characteristics. Please download the data "CreditCard_SOW_Data.csv" from Canvas. It has the following variables:
