# Random-Effects-and-Hierarchical-Linear-Models

The credit card company would like to figure out whether offering more promotions to their existing customers can increase the share-of-wallet of the credit card (that is, the share of a consumer's monthly spending using the credit card in her total spending). The company would also like to figure out what customer characteristics make them more responsive to promotions. 

The company conducted a field experiment by randomly selecting 300 customers and offering them different monthly promotions for 12 months. The share-of-wallet data were recorded in each month for every customer. The data set also included some consumer characteristics. 

- ConsumerID:   	ID's of the sampled consumers
- History:	How long (number of months) the customer has been using the card before the experiment
- Income:	The customer's annual income
- WalletShare:	The card's share of wallet in the consumer's total monthly spending    
- Promotion	Index: of monthly promotion activity â€“higher index indicates more pomotions
- Balance:	The customer's unpaid balance at the beginning of the month
